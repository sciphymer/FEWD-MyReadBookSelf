# MyReads Project

## Introduction

This project is a Book Tracking app. It is originally started with a static web page showing a book shelf recording books in different states: "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", "Read" with covering image, author and book names.

By using the Frontend framework of "React", the web page is transformed to:
1. Dynamically fetching books data from past records stored from the backend.
2. Books will move to different states of book shelf according to a change in reading state chosen from the book's drop down menu.
3. Can search the books from the search page and real time list out the possible the books' results.
4. Changing the books reading status in the searching page can add the book to the main page.
5. The url will change according to the main page and search page.

## How to launch

In command line, at the root path of the project, type `npm install`, this will automatically install all the package dependency. Then type `npm start`, it will start the project's react server.
The web site can be access through "localhost:3000" from a web browser.

## Point to note

Since this project focus on the implementation of using React framework on the frontend design, the function of searching books API provided by Udacity is for idea demostration only.
The keywords can be searched only according to those search terms written in "SEACH_TERMS.md".
